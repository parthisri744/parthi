        <p>Life is a continuous ongoing process that has to end someday. 
            Life is all about adoring yourself, creating yourself. A quote for you that life can be only understood backward but it must be lived forwards. 
            Life itself is a golden opportunity to live a meaningful life and support others to do so.
            It doesn’t matter how many years you live. But it matters how well you live a quality life.Human life is truly a very precious gift.
            Each moment of human life carries us an opportunity, to act to develop and express our virtues. 
            Every moment unlocks the path to us to receive blessings. This is the truth that life gives us both positive and negative situations.
            What is really important is how we react.</p>
            <center><h1>”Good things take time so just be positive and patient”</h1></center>
            <p>Life is the gift of God in the form of trust that we will make it meaningful in whatever we can. We are all unique individuals. 
                No one is born like you and no one will ever be, so cherish your individuality. Many times, I come across people accusing God of things that they don’t have. 
                They always cursing their lives. But, do they realize that this life itself is precious? If we make it worth living and work hard towards positivity.</p>
